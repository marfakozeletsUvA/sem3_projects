    "## Assessment criteria specific to SNA\n",
    " - Data Acquisition and cleaning: Obtains or constructs a network dataset and performs basic preprocessing (e.g., removing duplicates, handling isolated nodes, defining edges/nodes sensibly).\n",
    " - Network construction: Builds the network using appropriate representations (directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted) and provides a short justification of the modelling choices.\n",
    " - Core network metrics: Computes and reports key network measures (e.g., degree, centrality, clustering, path length) and interprets what they mean in the context of the chosen dataset.\n",
    " - Community detection: Applies at least one method that reveals community structure and interprets the result.\n",
    " - Visualization: Produces at least one meaningful visualization (e.g., network plot), which is readable and interpretable.\n",
    " - Substantive interpretation: Connects network metrics and findings to a broader explanation of the social phenomenon studied."
