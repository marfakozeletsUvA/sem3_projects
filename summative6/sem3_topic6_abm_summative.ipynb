    "\n",
    "## Assessment criteria specific to ABM\n",
    " - Clear model specification: Defines the agents, environment, rules, and parameters in a structured manner (e.g., in words or with a simple schematic).\n",
    " - Correct implementation of model logic:\n",
    " - lements the model without errors or warnings, ensuring that agent interactions follow the described rules.\n",
    " - Simulation experiments: Runs the model multiple times or across different parameter settings, generating output suitable for analysis (e.g., time series, distributions, aggregate outcomes).\n",
    " - Visualization of model behavior: Presents at least one clear visualization of simulation results.\n",
    " - Interpretation of dynamics: Interprets how the model behaves and explains why certain outcomes emerge based on agent rules and interactions, and implications for the phenomenon under study.\n",
    " - Sensitivity analysis: Vary at least one key parameter and shows how the system responds (e.g., tipping points, stability, divergence). (Does not require formal statistical testing.)\n",
    " - (Optional) Calibration and validation: If relevant, connects the model to real data (e.g., calibrating parameters, or validating against real-world data)."
