    "# SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "For this summative assignment, we ask you to find a dataset from an internet source of choice. You will then create an NLP pipeline including preprocessing, NLP analysis, and classification.\n",
    "Your anlysis for this notebook should have two parts: An initial NLP analysis (as done in formative notebook 1), and a classification of these results (as done in formative notebook 2). Chose one method for each of these two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should chose ONE of the following:\n",
    " - Sentiment Analysis\n",
    " - LDA\n",
    " - BertTopic\n",
    "\n",
    "You should ALSO chose ONE of the following:\n",
    " - Decision Tree / Random Forest\n",
    " - LLM-based text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The general assessment criteria for all summative assignments are mentioned in the assignment description on Canvas. Each notebook also has a few specific criteria we look for; make sure you fulfil them in your approach to this assignment.\n",
    "In general, make sure this notebook represents a complete project: Write an explanation of what you are hoping to achieve with your analysis, document your code well, and present results in a comprehensive way.\n",
    "The assessment criteria for this notebook vary slightly depending on which methods you chose to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
    " - Selected an appropriate dataset and prepared it for analysis, including cleaning and formatting the data.\n",
    " - Effectively pre-processed the text data, including steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and handling special characters.\n",
    " - Selected an appropriate sentiment analysis model or algorithm for their dataset and correctly implemented the sentiment analysis model, ensuring it is properly trained and tested.\n",
    " - Provided a clear and insightful interpretation of the sentiment analysis results, explaining the significance and implications of their findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LDA \n",
    " - Selected an appropriate dataset and prepared it for analysis, including cleaning and formatting the data.\n",
    " - Correctly created a document-term matrix or equivalent representation suitable for LDA.\n",
    " - Selected appropriate parameters for the LDA model, such as the number of topics and hyperparameters.\n",
    " - Correctly implemented the LDA model, ensuring it is properly trained on the dataset.\n",
    " - Provided a clear and insightful interpretation of the topics, explaining the significance and relevance of the discovered topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BertTopic\n",
    " - Selected an appropriate dataset and prepared it for analysis, including cleaning and formatting the data.\n",
    " - Correctly generated text embeddings using a suitable model for input into BERTopic.\n",
    " - Correctly implemented the BERTopic model, ensuring it is properly trained on the dataset.\n",
    " - Accurately extracted and represented topics from the BERTopic model.\n",
    " - Provided a clear and insightful interpretation of the topics, explaining the significance and relevance of the discovered topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree / Random Forest\n",
    " - Formulated a relevant and appropriate classification objective for the NLP task.\n",
    " - Pre-processed the text data appropriately, including vecterization and other necessary steps.\n",
    " - Properly trained and tested the decision tree or random forest model.\n",
    " - Accurately print or visualize the results, or provide insightful interpretation of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LLM-based text classification\n",
    " - Formulated a relevant and appropriate classification objective for the NLP task.\n",
    " - Correctly prepared the data for the LLM, ensuring it is suitable for model input.\n",
    " - Properly ran the LLM and tested the LLM output.\n",

    "Preprocessing can involve some combination of the following steps. Which steps to use depends on what you want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Remove unwanted or empty messages.* We start by cleaning the data, removing messages that are unlikely to contain any useful text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Text Cleaning.*\n",
    "The first step is to clean the text. We remove any irrelevant items like HTML tags, URLs, and codes when dealing with web data. We also get rid of special characters, numbers, or punctuation that might not be necessary for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Case Normalization.*\n",
    "Next, we normalize the case by converting all the text to lower case. This ensures that words like 'House', 'house', and 'HOUSE' are all treated as the same word, preventing the model from treating them as different entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Tokenization.*\n",
    "Then we move to tokenization. This is where we break down the text into smaller pieces, or tokens. Tokens can be words, phrases, or even sentences. In English, this might seem as simple as splitting by spaces, but it can get complicated with languages that don’t use spaces or have complex morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Stop Words Removal.*\n",
    "After tokenization, we often remove stop words. These are common words like 'is', 'and', 'the', which appear frequently in the text but usually don’t carry significant meaning for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Lemmatization.*\n",
    "Now, we refine our tokens using ste lemmatization. This strips the words down to their root form. For example, 'running', 'runs', and 'ran' might all be reduced to 'run'."
