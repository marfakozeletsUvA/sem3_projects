    "# SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "For this summative assignment, we ask you to find a dataset from an internet source of choice. You will then create an NLP pipeline including preprocessing, NLP analysis, and classification.\n",
    "Your anlysis for this notebook should have two parts: An initial NLP analysis (as done in formative notebook 1), and a classification of these results (as done in formative notebook 2). Chose one method for each of these two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should chose ONE of the following:\n",
    " - Sentiment Analysis\n",
    " - LDA\n",
    " - BertTopic\n",
    "\n",
    "You should ALSO chose ONE of the following:\n",
    " - Decision Tree / Random Forest\n",
    " - LLM-based text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The general assessment criteria for all summative assignments are mentioned in the assignment description on Canvas. Each notebook also has a few specific criteria we look for; make sure you fulfil them in your approach to this assignment.\n",
    "In general, make sure this notebook represents a complete project: Write an explanation of what you are hoping to achieve with your analysis, document your code well, and present results in a comprehensive way.\n",
    "The assessment criteria for this notebook vary slightly depending on which methods you chose to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
    " - Selected an appropriate dataset and prepared it for analysis, including cleaning and formatting the data.\n",
    " - Effectively pre-processed the text data, including steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and handling special characters.\n",
    " - Selected an appropriate sentiment analysis model or algorithm for their dataset and correctly implemented the sentiment analysis model, ensuring it is properly trained and tested.\n",
    " - Provided a clear and insightful interpretation of the sentiment analysis results, explaining the significance and implications of their findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LDA \n",
    " - Selected an appropriate dataset and prepared it for analysis, including cleaning and formatting the data.\n",
    " - Correctly created a document-term matrix or equivalent representation suitable for LDA.\n",
    " - Selected appropriate parameters for the LDA model, such as the number of topics and hyperparameters.\n",
    " - Correctly implemented the LDA model, ensuring it is properly trained on the dataset.\n",
    " - Provided a clear and insightful interpretation of the topics, explaining the significance and relevance of the discovered topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BertTopic\n",
    " - Selected an appropriate dataset and prepared it for analysis, including cleaning and formatting the data.\n",
    " - Correctly generated text embeddings using a suitable model for input into BERTopic.\n",
    " - Correctly implemented the BERTopic model, ensuring it is properly trained on the dataset.\n",
    " - Accurately extracted and represented topics from the BERTopic model.\n",
    " - Provided a clear and insightful interpretation of the topics, explaining the significance and relevance of the discovered topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree / Random Forest\n",
    " - Formulated a relevant and appropriate classification objective for the NLP task.\n",
    " - Pre-processed the text data appropriately, including vecterization and other necessary steps.\n",
    " - Properly trained and tested the decision tree or random forest model.\n",
    " - Accurately print or visualize the results, or provide insightful interpretation of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LLM-based text classification\n",
    " - Formulated a relevant and appropriate classification objective for the NLP task.\n",
    " - Correctly prepared the data for the LLM, ensuring it is suitable for model input.\n",
    " - Properly ran the LLM and tested the LLM output.\n",
    " - Accurately print or visualize the results, or provide insightful interpretation of the findings."
