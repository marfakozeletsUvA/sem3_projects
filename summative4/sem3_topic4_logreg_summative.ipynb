    "The general assessment criteria for all summative assignments are mentioned in the assignment description on Canvas. Each notebook also has a few specific criteria we look for; make sure you fulfil them in your approach to this assignment.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Assessment criteria specific to logistic regression\n",
    " - Fitted both homogeneous and heterogeneous probability models, ensuring no errors or warnings and checking for multicollinearity through coefficient inspection.\n",
    " - Used and plotted simulations to assess coefficient significance.\n",
    " - Generated predicted probabilities and plotted posterior predictive distributions with visualizations, including histograms or intervals for uncertainty.\n",
    " - Correctly interpreted coefficients and plots in terms of magnitude, direction, statistical significance, and odds rather than log-odds.\n",
    " - Compared homogeneous and heterogeneous models using the AIC criterion and provided an accurate interpretation of the results.\n",
    " - Calculates and plots a correlation matrix to explore underlying relationships in the data.\n",
    " - Performs model selection via a sensible method, such as cross-validation, split in train-validation- test, or use of AIC or other complexity-adjusted metrics.\n",
    " - Generates predicted probabilities for different observations. If they only predicted class, give half a point.\n",
    " - By plotting or in some other way, presents the predicted probabilities for at least 1 observation, and shows comparison against true class.\n",
    " - Computes the generalisation error for a sensible metric of choice."
