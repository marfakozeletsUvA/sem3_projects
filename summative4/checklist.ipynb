    "# PCOS Diagnosis Prediction: A Logistic Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Which clinical and lifestyle factors are most predictive of PCOS diagnosis, and do these effects vary across demographic groups (e.g., by ethnicity or socioeconomic status)?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** Global PCOS diagnostic data\n",
    "- **Size:** 120,000 observations × 17 variables\n",
    "- **Target Variable:** `Diagnosis` (Yes/No) — 10.5% positive cases, class imbalance ratio ~8.5:1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Variables |\n",
    "|----------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Target** | `Diagnosis` (Binary: Yes/No) |\n",
    "| **Clinical Symptoms** | `Menstrual Regularity`, `Hirsutism`, `Acne Severity`, `BMI`, `Insulin Resistance` |\n",
    "| **Medical History** | `Family History of PCOS` |\n",
    "| **Lifestyle Factors** | `Lifestyle Score`, `Stress Levels` |\n",
    "| **Demographics** | `Age`, `Ethnicity`, `Country` |\n",

    "## Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation & Exploration\n",
    "- Load and inspect data\n",
    "- Handle missing values\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables\n",
    "- **Calculate and plot correlation matrix** to explore underlying relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Homogeneous Model (Baseline)\n",
    "- Fit logistic regression using core clinical predictors only\n",
    "- Predictors: `BMI`, `Hirsutism`, `Acne Severity`, `Menstrual Regularity`, `Insulin Resistance`, `Family History of PCOS`\n",
    "- Check for multicollinearity via coefficient inspection\n",
    "- Ensure no errors or warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Heterogeneous Model (Extended)\n",
    "- Add demographic and socioeconomic predictors: `Age`, `Ethnicity`, `Socioeconomic Status`, `Urban/Rural`\n",
    "- Include interaction terms (e.g., `Ethnicity × Insulin Resistance`)\n",
    "- Compare complexity and fit against homogeneous model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Coefficient Significance Assessment\n",
    "- Use simulations to assess coefficient significance\n",
    "- Plot simulation results\n",
    "- Interpret coefficients in terms of **odds ratios** (not log-odds)\n",
    "- Discuss magnitude, direction, and statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Model Comparison\n",
    "- Compare homogeneous vs. heterogeneous models using **AIC criterion**\n",
    "- Interpret which model provides better balance of fit and parsimony\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Model Selection & Validation\n",
    "- Perform model selection via **cross-validation** or **train-validation-test split**\n",
    "- Use complexity-adjusted metrics (AIC/BIC) to guide selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Predicted Probabilities & Uncertainty\n",
    "- Generate predicted probabilities for observations\n",
    "- Plot **posterior predictive distributions**\n",
    "- Visualise uncertainty using histograms or credible intervals\n",
    "- Compare predicted probabilities against true class for specific observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Generalisation Error\n",
    "- Compute generalisation error using appropriate metric (e.g., log-loss, Brier score, or AUC-ROC)\n",
    "- Report and interpret model performance on held-out data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Expected Outputs\n",

    "1. Correlation matrix heatmap\n",
