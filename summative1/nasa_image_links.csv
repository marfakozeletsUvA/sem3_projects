Curiosity,Mount Sharp 'Photobombs' Curiosity,"This self-portrait of NASA's Curiosity Mars rover shows the vehicle on Vera Rubin Ridge, which it's been investigating for the past several months. Directly behind the rover is the start of a clay-rich slope scientists are eager to begin exploring. In the coming week, Curiosity will begin to climb this slope. North is on the left and west is on the right, with Gale Crater's rim on the horizon of both edges.  Poking up just behind Curiosity's mast is Mount Sharp, photobombing the robot's selfie. Curiosity landed on Mars five years ago with the intention of studying lower Mount Sharp, where it will remain for all of its time on Mars. The mountain's base provides access to layers formed over millions of years. These layers formed in the presence of water -- likely due to a lake or lakes that sat at the bottom of the mountain, which sits inside of Gale Crater.  This mosaic was assembled from dozens of images taken by Curiosity's Mars Hands Lens Imager (MAHLI). They were all taken on Jan. 23, 2018, during Sol 1943.  The view does not include the rover's arm nor the MAHLI camera itself, except in the miniature scene reflected upside down in the parabolic mirror at the top of the mast. That mirror is part of Curiosity's Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument. MAHLI appears in the center of the mirror.  Wrist motions and turret rotations on the arm allowed MAHLI to acquire the mosaic's component images. The arm was positioned out of the shot in the images, or portions of images, that were used in this mosaic.  A full-resolution image is available at https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22207",2018-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,PIA22207,image,https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA22207/PIA22207~medium.jpg
Curiosity,Curiosity is Ready for Clay (Highlighted),"This mosaic taken by NASA's Mars Curiosity rover looks uphill at Mount Sharp, which Curiosity has been climbing. Highlighted in white is an area with clay-bearing rocks that scientists are eager to explore; it could shed additional light on the role of water in creating Mount Sharp. The mosaic was assembled from dozens of images taken by Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam). It was taken on Sol 1931 back in January.  Mount Sharp stands in the middle of Gale Crater, which is 96 miles (154 kilometers) in diameter. This mound, which Curiosity has been climbing since 2014, likely formed in the presence of water at various points of time in Mars ancient history. That makes it an ideal place to study how water influenced the habitability of Mars billions of years ago.  The scene has been white-balanced so the colors of the rock materials resemble how they would appear under daytime lighting conditions on Earth.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22312",2018-03-22 00:00:00+00:00,PIA22312,image,https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA22312/PIA22312~medium.jpg

Perseverance,From 'Tribulation' to 'Perseverance' on Mars,"This graphic shows the route that NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity drove in its final approach to 'Perseverance Valley' on the western rim of Endeavour Crater.  The map covers an area about four-tenths of a mile (two-thirds of a kilometer) wide, with the interior of the crater on the right. Opportunity entered this mapped area from the north along the gold traverse line on March 21, 2017, approaching the southern tip of the ""Cape Tribulation"" segment of Endeavour's rim. It reached the top of ""Perseverance Valley"" with a drive on Sol 4720 (the 4,720th Martian day) of the mission, on May 4, 2017.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21496",2017-05-15 17:55:02+00:00,PIA21496,image,https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21496/PIA21496~medium.jpg
